	# DESCRIPTION
	
	This script looks for a Template folder and asks you to pick one of the templates within to create 
	an instance of. It then allows you to select a folder for the instance and to choose the desired values
	for any variables designated in the last paragraph of the project's note (by default, "$" before a word
	designates it as a variable, an ode to my favorite CSS preprocessor, SASS).
	
	Some other goodies:
		-	You can specify relative start or due dates (one or the other, not both… yet) for the project
			and/or each task individually. To do so, put a paragraph somewhere in the note of that item that
			starts with either "Due" or "Start". Then use the same natural language date syntax as you can usually
			use in OmniFocus/ my "Later" Applescript: things like "today + 2d", "2d", "3w 4d 2pm", etc., will all
			work as expected, hopefully. All of these will be relative to the date you run the script.
		-	Variables can be used in project names and notes, task names and notes, and task context names
		-	On the first run it detects if you have projects using Curt Clifton's OmniFocus template syntax
			(to which I owe a lot of the good ideas in this script) and offers to change it for you.
		-	It offers to show you the new instance of the template once it has populated the instance.
		-	Automagically changes the new project instance to "Active" if the template project was "On Hold"

	# INSTALLATION
	
	-	Copy this script to ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Omnifocus (you may have to use the
		Go > Go to Folder… menu in your file navigation application of choice as the user library
		folder is hidden on Mac OS X 10.7+. After you select this menu item, type the path above and
		hit enter).
	-	If you prefer, you can have this script be activated by a utility like Keyboard Maestro or FastScripts
	
	
	# VERSION INFORMATION
		
		0.3.1 (February 28, 2013): Bugfixes.
		0.3.0 (February 24, 2013): Fixed an issue with subtracting dates. Improved Growl alerts. Added an option to put "attachment: ask" in
		the task notes to have the script ask you for an attachment to that task. Variables can now be given a list of values to choose from
		using the notation $variableName {option 1, option 2, option3} in the project note. If you use the variable "$today", the
		variable will automatically be assigned the date you create the new instance. Added a screencast, readme, and website.
		0.2.9 (February 13, 2013): Preserves non-embedded attachments to tasks
		0.2.8 (February 13, 2013): Fixed the compile-time option of putting the project at the beginning of the list.
		Changed notifications over to Growl. You can also have the script ask if a certain task should be completed or
		not by putting "complete: ask" anywhere in its note.
		0.2.7 (February 11, 2013): Fixed an issue where the template wouldn't instantiate properly if there were no variables.
		Added a compile-time option to put the project at the beginning of the project list
		0.2.6 (February 7, 2013): Now works with template folders that are dropped.
		0.2.5 (January 30, 2013): New "$date" variables — will ask you for a date instead of a string (you can use all of the
		same relative/ absolute shorthand forms in defining the date, and it can be used in conjunction with the "start" / 
		"due" identifiers)
		0.2.4 (January 22, 2013): Other bugfixes
		0.2.3 (January 22, 2013): Fix for setting default folder to a subfolder
		0.2.2 (January 22, 2013): Allows you to set both a start and due date. Fixes a bug where due/ start declarations
		in projects wouldn't be eliminated when a new instance was created.
		0.2.1 (January 22, 2013): Does a better job of cleaning up notes and allows variables on any line of project
		0.2 (January 21, 2013): using the keyword "ask" in after the start/due declaration in the note of a task/ project will have the
		script prompt you to enter a relative or absolute start/due date for that item. Similarly, you can use the keyword
		"project" to set the start/ due date relative to that of the project; the script will take whatever is
		after the keyword and subtract it from the due date/ add it to the start date of the project, as the
		case may be. Finally, using the (by default) ">>>" operator in the second, followed by a string that EXACTLY matches
		one of the folders in your OF library will skip the folder selection dialog and put the new instance
		directly in the designated folder. Plus, fancy icon.
		0.1.1 (January 18, 2013): Handles projects in a template folder without variables more gracefully (thanks, Sven!)
		0.1 (January 18, 2013): Initial release
